Notebooks, random calculations along the way to LSST figures of merit.

**2016-03-29** Repository started with notebooks and routines written in 
late Jan 2015 in order to produce the strawman "Galactic Supernova" 
figure of merit.

This is an example of a FoM where the pre-computed metric (over all the 
sky) can be multiplied by another metric, and summed to produce the FoM 
desired.
