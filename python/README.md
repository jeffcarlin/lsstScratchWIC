## Standalone copies of metrics ##

(WIC) When running on my system I found it convenient to make standalone .py copies of 
certain sims_maf or maf_contrib exmaples. Current contents:

* **AsTransientMetric.py** - Copy of TransientMetric() - I think originally authored 
by Peter Yoachim.

* **StarCountStandalone.py** - Copy of Mike Lund's CountMetric, but with RA and DEC 
called by keyword rather than index
