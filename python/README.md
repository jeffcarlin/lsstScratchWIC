## Standalone copies of metrics ##

(WIC) When running on my system I found it convenient to make standalone .py copies of 
certain sims_maf or maf_contrib exmaples. Current contents:

* **AsTransientMetric.py** - Copy of TransientMetric() - I think originally authored 
by Peter Yoachim.

* **StarCountStandalone.py** - Copy of Mike Lund's CountMetric, but with RA and DEC 
called by keyword rather than index

* **runAstrom.py** - Hacked out of Peter Yoachim's original 
*runAstrom.py* , this runs the astrometry metrics detailed in Chapter 
4.4 of the Whitepaper, on baseline and PanSTARRS-like opsim runs. 
Updated for the 2016 versions of OpSim and sims_maf. * **Currently 
requires the github version of sims_maf to work, or the latest version 
of the confluence sims_maf.** *
