# README #

Working directory for figure-of-merit experimentation. 

At this date (2016-04-10) I think it's probably easiest if paths within notebooks are relative to this directory, so that 
upon downloading the repository the user can start to make progress right away. This is implemented for 
FigureOfMerit_4p3_Galactic_Supernova.ipynb .
